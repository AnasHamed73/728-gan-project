# Shape Based Logo Generation Using Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks 

## Introduction

This project aims to provide a framework of logo generation using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)
trained on a large dataset of logos. The idea is to take a geometrical shape from a predefined set of shapes
(e.g. square, circular,  etc.), and generate a set of logos with characteristics that resemble that shape.
The user can specify the shape by providing it as a one-hot encoded vector to the network.
This, not only helps generate cleaner and more plausible images, but also narrows down the set of ideas 
to better match what the artist has in mind.

## Dataset

The **Large Logo Dataset** was used to train the model. The dataset can be found at the following link:

## Project Files & Directories

Below is a description of each directory and its role in the project:

Files:

1. **generate.py**: generates a batch images using a saved checkpoint of the generator model
2. **acwgangp.py**: contains the training code along with some functions related to training
3. **detect_shape.py**: classifies the shape of a given image as one of: square, circle or other
4. **model.py**: contains the generator, discriminator and classifier architectures
5. **partition.py**: partitions the training set into separate directories according to the file containing the one hot encoding file
in the img_shapes directory

Directories:

1. **checkpoint**: contains a generator checkpoint that is used by the generate.py script
2. **img_shapes**: contains files that classify the dataset in terms of shape
2. **output_sample**: a sample of the output that was generated by the generator at a certain checkpoint
